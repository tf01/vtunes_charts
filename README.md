# vtunes_charts
Enjoyment scores from the RC discord server of various albums


Going to use the main branch for a live github pages page to display the results

# Idea
Instead of trying to place the text in the md files, I should just completely generate them. I can have constant files that hold the rest of the normal text lines, and then just piece together the entire page with the script.

### My notes

`old notes` 
**updated notes**
wii wii woo - 9.5 
`great drums, great bass, great guitar, great vocal, great`
**still great, haven't grown tired of it. It's on my playlist twice**
template - 7.5
`really like the track again. The tone shifts are good, which is something I'm not usually a fan of`
**Still like + listen to this one, but dropping it by 0.5. I think it's the intro that I'm not a fan of**
michi - 9.1
`really interesting instrumentation + everything else. swing is great`
**Sticking with my guns here, bring it on RC**
hanamidori - 6.5 
`cool, but not as interesting as the last one`
**dropping by 0.5, haven't listened to it since the review**
true girl show - 5.5 
`what was that audio in the beginning? Otherwise alright, just not my style. really like the clapping in the mix`
**dropping by 0.5, haven't listened to it since the review**
my happy transmission - 5.5 
it's pretty alright. Nice song
**dropping by 1, not sure why I said it was 'pretty alright'**
d-ball - 9.2 
`like the simplicity, the repeating drums at the start/end are good. also when the instrumental drops out, really good. The piano/synth or something throughout is the highlight`
**I've warmed up to this one the most I think. Those piano notes at the back of the mix are toooo good**
7days - 8.8
`really fun, lots of bass and nice instruments (brass) want to play the game to see if the melody is used anywhere`
**scratch that, this one is the one that I've warmed up to the most for sure. Not super complex and just really easy listening imo. very fun**
damn good day - 7.5 
`saxophone! Nice instrumentation, brass to the right and a flute (?) to the left.`
**about the same**
soiree - 6.5 
`interesting rhythms, and good panning for the drums on that one bit going from left to right. not a fan of the switch to trap drums in the latter third though for that one section. Was trying to do a few too many things and failed I think, they should've ran with a couple of the better ideas in there`
**dropping by 0.5, haven't listened to it**
newton - 7
`I like the playing around with the synthy/modified instruments, lots and lots of detail if you're not listening to the youtube music compressed version lol. The last third isn't very interesting though. I really like the sign off as well, nice piano`
**dropped by 1. even though I like this one, the compression has killed its listening for me LOL. I guess I should switch off YT music and just listen to flacs on my phone instead**
