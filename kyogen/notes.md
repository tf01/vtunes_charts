Readymade
- Rhythmically interesting to listen to
- Like instrumentation?
- Good singing, at least to my untrained ears
  - Although is there a filter over some of it?
- baseball motif on the mv?

Odo
- Heard this one before
- Gunshots? Not sure how I feel about that one musically. it's certainly unique percussion(?)
- Like it!
- It's against my general tastes
- Rhythmically interesting in a different way
- MV is interesting, 4:3 and about cameras

Domestic De Violence
- Like this swingy rhythm
- though melody could have a bit more?
- Piano is a bit repetitive, and sounds sample-y

Freedom
- More typical rock sound
- Samey throughout
- MV is absolutely minced by youtube compression

Fireworks
- Funny they said end credits, that's what I was thinking bout this song.
- Not too interesting, but not too uninteresting. 
- I usually like chill stuff, but I think I would prefer a more atmospheric tone without the percussion
- MV is very good, relaxing

Aitakute
- Slower one, nice intensity.
- I like the strings
- Is this unreciprocated love? Or like, they can't be together for some reason?

Lucky Bruto
- ???
- Interesting? One listen is enough

Gira Gira
- Heard this one before, it's pretty good.
- I like the weird scraping sound in the right ear, it's like asmr
- Track is pretty good

Ashura-chan
- Brass heavy
- I like the style!
- Very fun sounding, maybe in contrast to the lyrics
- Not a fan of the breakdown in the middle, way too much whiplash for me

KokoroToluNanoFukakai
- I like the instrumentation, piano for the intro to the verses
  - Chorus features a nice clean electric
- Very cool synths too, nice beeps
- Medical themes mv?
- might be my favourite other than Odo so far
- Like the continuation of the chorus melody towards the end

Usseewa
- I think I've heard this one?
- The snare sound is funny
- Generally pretty good
- Track is fairly samey, but with a very in-your-face key change towards the end

Motherland
- This one puts the voice behind the track, which is a nice changeup
- Nice use of claps and finger clicks
- Otherwise it's pretty good. Not too much to say about the track

Kagakashu
- Autotune/pitch changing? Interesting sound, but I'm not sure people will like it on Ado
- Otherwise, sounds alright. The autotune seems to cut in and out? Which is an interesting style choice
- I actually like the track. Distinct phrases thanks to the syncing rhythms between instruments

Yoru No Pierrot
- Sounds pretty normal? Nothing is jumping out at me.
